# 1. Introduction
Business Scenario and Objectives: In a competitive job market, organizations must optimize compensation structures to attract and retain top talent while maintaining financial sustainability. This project focuses on analyzing salary progression relative to years of experience, a key driver in compensation decisions. The insights aim to guide organizations in designing competitive pay structures, forecasting future salary trends, and addressing potential gaps in workforce planning.
Management Question: How does employee experience influence salary progression, and what forecasting model best predicts salary trends to aid in compensation planning and workforce budgeting?
By answering this question, the organization can:
•	Ensure competitive salaries to retain talent.
•	Optimize budgets for workforce planning.
•	Design data-driven career progression frameworks.

# 2. Analyze and Comment on the Data
Dataset Insights:
•	The dataset contains two key variables: Years of Experience and Salary.
•	Linear Growth Trend: Salary increases as years of experience grow, with a clear upward trend.
•	Variability at Milestones: Variations in salary are observed at certain experience levels (e.g., 4 years and 8 years), potentially due to job changes or industry factors.
•	No Missing Data: The dataset is complete, which simplifies modeling and forecasting efforts.
Appropriateness for Modeling:
•	The dataset is well-suited for linear regression and time-series forecasting methods due to its numerical and sequential nature.
•	Absence of additional variables (e.g., education, industry, role) limits the depth of salary prediction models and insights into other influencing factors.
Potential Limitations:
•	Small dataset size may reduce the generalizability of results.
•	Lack of demographic details restricts multi-factor analysis (e.g., age, gender).

# 3. Data Collection
The dataset is publicly available at Kaggle. It represents realistic salary progression and can be extended for workforce modeling by adding more variables.

# 4. Data Analysis
Using the data set provided, various forecasting methods were evaluated to model and predict salary trends. The goal was to minimize prediction errors and ensure accurate insights for management decisions.
Models Applied:
1.	Winters' Forecasting Method (Triple Exponential Smoothing):
o	Captures trends and seasonality.
o	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 27,439,356
o	Performs well for datasets with consistent patterns, though seasonality in this dataset is limited.
2.	Exponential Smoothing (Single Smoothing):
o	Smooths data without accounting for trends or seasonality.
o	MSE: 54,814,741
o	Struggles to capture the upward trend effectively.
3.	Moving Average (3-Year and 5-Year):
o	Smooths short-term fluctuations.
o	3-Year MSE: 20,721,759 (lowest error in simple models).
o	5-Year MSE: Higher than the 3-year moving average, indicating less adaptability to the dataset.
4.	Regression Analysis (Linear):
o	Predicts salary using the equation:
Salary=25077+9582×(Experience)
o	MSE: 1,152,850,273 due to cumulative error over multiple predictions.
5.	Trendline + Seasonal Adjustments:
o	Combines linear trends with seasonality indices.
o	MSE: 152,453,429
o	Moderately effective in capturing variability but less precise than Winters' method.
6.	Solver Optimization (Linear Best Fit):
o	Adjust parameters to minimize error.
o	Results are not explicitly reported but improves linear model accuracy.

# 5. Determine the Best Forecasting Method
Error Analysis:
•	Best Method: Winters' Forecasting Method achieved the lowest MSE (27,439,356), making it the most accurate for this dataset.
•	Runner-Up: 3-Year Moving Average with MSE of 20,721,759, which is simpler but less robust than Winters' method.
Rationale:
•	Winters' method captures both trend and short-term variability.
•	Moving Average is easier to implement but lacks adaptability to fluctuations in salary progression.
Error Analysis Across Models:
Model	MSE	Comments
Winters' Forecasting	27,439,356	Best for dynamic trends and short-term changes.
Moving Average (3-Year)	20,721,759	Simplistic but performs well for gradual trends.
Exponential Smoothing (Single)	54,814,741	Too simplistic for linear salary growth.
Linear Regression	1,152,850,273	High residual errors reduce reliability.
Trendline with Seasonal Adj.	152,453,429	Better than regression but less accurate overall.
